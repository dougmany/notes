Instant pot Chili

Ingredients:
2.5 lbs Chuck steak
2 poblano chilies
1 1/2 cup dried chili bean mix
1 28oz can whole tomatoes
1 Tbs chili powder
1 Tbs paprika
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)

Steps:
* Soak bean for 30-200 minutes.  Cover with ample water and add a large amount of salt.  The water should last like the sea.*

* Cut beef into 1 1/2 inch cubes.  If you are going to cook right way, sear the beef in the instant pot on saut√© setting. 

* Roast the poblanos over a gas stove until all sides are black.  Place in a paper bag for five minutes.  Rinse the peppers under cold water, rubbing off the skin and removing the stem and seeds.  Cut into 1 inch pieces.

* Combine poblano, beef, tomatoes and one can of water.  Squish the tomatoes in your hands to break them up.  If you are making this the next day, these three ingredients can be put into a bowl and refrigerates until ready to cook.

* Drain the beans.  If you seared the beef, stirring in the cold wet beans will do a good job of cleaning up the beef crust on the bottom of the pot.   Add all ingredients.  If needed, cover beans in one inch of water.  Press the beans/chili button and make sure the pot is in seal mode.    

* When the pot goes into warm mode, vent and enjoy.

* The main reason for the salt soak is to exchange ions in the skin of the beans, softening the skins which leads to a creamier bean.

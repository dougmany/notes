	<h1>Instant pot Chili</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2.5 lbs chuck steak</li>
		<li>2 poblano chilies</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cup dried chili bean mix</li>
		<li>1 28oz can whole tomatoes (avoid brands with calcium chloride)</li>
		<li>1 Tbs chili powder</li>
		<li>1 Tbs paprika</li>
		<li>2 tsp cumin</li>
		<li>1 tsp oregano</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Soak bean for 30-200 minutes. Cover with ample water and add a large amount of salt. The water should taste
			like
			the sea.*</li>
		<li>Cut beef into 1 1/2 inch cubes. If you are going to cook right way, sear the beef in the instant pot on
			saut√©
			setting. </li>
		<li>Roast the poblanos over a flame until all sides are black. Place in a closed paper bag for five minutes.
			Rinse
			the peppers under cold water, rubbing off the skin and removing the stem and seeds. Cut into 1 inch pieces..
		</li>
		<li>Combine poblano, beef, tomatoes and one can of water. Squish the tomatoes in your hands to break them up. If
			you
			are making this the next day, these three ingredients can be put into a bowl and refrigerated until ready to
			cook..</li>
		<li>Drain the beans. If you seared the beef, stir the cold wet beans around to clean up the beef crust on the
			bottom
			of the pot.</li>
		<li>Add all ingredients. Depending on how long the beans soaked, cover beans in one to two inches of water.
			Press
			the beans/chili button and make sure the lid valve is in seal mode..</li>
		<li>When the pot goes into warm mode, vent and enjoy.</li>

	</ul>
	<p>*The salt soak will allow for an ion exchange in the skin of the beans, softening the skins which leads to a
		creamier
		bean.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Desiccated coconut</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Powdered Jaggery</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Dry roast sesame seeds untill they pop.</li>
        <li>Dry roast the coconut untill slightly brown.</li>
        <li>Take sesame seeds, coconut and grated jaggery in a mixer.</li>

        <li>Take the mixture in bowl.</li>

    <p>Notes: Traditionally they use kithul jaggery in Srilanka for making this sweet. You can use any type of jaggery.
        Shape them as you wish. I used fresh coconut and roasted them nicely. Desiccated coconut is preferred for more
        shelf life</p>

	<h1>ChatGPT Poem</h1>
	<p>Can you write me a poem about software engineering?</p>
	<p>Sure! Here's a poem about software engineering:</p>
	<p>In the realm of code and programming,
		<br>Where zeros and ones are all-consuming,
		<br>A software engineer takes the helm,
		<br>Guiding programs with a steady hand at the realm.
	</p>

	<p>Lines of code, like threads of a tapestry,
		<br>Weaving together into an intricate harmony,
		<br>Creating something out of nothingness,
		<br>A virtual world, free from mess.
	</p>

	<p>Debugging and troubleshooting, day and night,
		<br>Persevering with an unwavering might,
		<br>For a software engineer, the job's never done,
		<br>As there's always another line to be spun.
	</p>

	<p>But the thrill of solving a problem, so sublime,
		<br>Makes it all worth it, time after time,
		<br>As a software engineer watches their creation,
		<br>Unfold and thrive, with great elation.
	</p>

	<p>So here's to the software engineer, bold and true,
		<br>Creating wonders with each line anew,
		<br>In this digital age, they're the ones to thank,
		<br>For making our world a better place, day by day, byte by byte.
